              Targeting specs are ad set attributes that define who sees an ad.
              fivetran may create subtables named ads__targeting__[spec_name] for each targeting spec type that is applied to the ad set. For example: ads__targeting__life_events
              If you have many targeting specs applied to ads, a large number of subtables may be created in your destination.
